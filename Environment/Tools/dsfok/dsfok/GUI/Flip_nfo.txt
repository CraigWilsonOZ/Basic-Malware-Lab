FLIP v.1.02  Copyright 2001 Dariusz Stanislawek

This is a stand-alone implementation of the "flip" command from Edxor.

FLIP will do a simple bitwise reversion operation on any file; hiding
the headers from scanners and grep tools that search for duplicate headers 
in merged files. These modified files can then be appended to another file 
with a DOS "copy /b" command or with Edxor's "Insert" function to safely hide them. 

Flip supports drag and drop file handling. 

Flip.exe can also be used to temporarily disable an app or file 
from running or being accessed by unauthorised users without advertising 
the fact. They just get an error message.

TO HIDE SOMETHING USING THE FILE FLIPPER FROM THE COMMAND LINE:

1) run:  flip secret.zip   
2) do:  copy /b container.jpg + secret.zip  new.jpg   

TO RETRIEVE:

1) run:  flip new.jpg
2) unzip new.jpg with your zip-utility after renaming the 
   extension to *.zip


USING FLIP'S DRAG AND DROP FUNCTION

TO HIDE SOMETHING:

1) Drag a file to be hidden (usually a zip) onto "flip.exe" to flip it.
2) Open a host-file with Edxor; make sure the cursor is at the bottom by
   clicking the "Down" button; and choose "File/Insert" to append the 
   flipped file to host 
3) Click "File/Save".

TO RETRIEVE:

1) Drag host-file onto flip.exe
2) Temporarily change host-files extension to *.zip (***) 
3) Extract hidden material; re-flip the host-file and re-name the extension to hide it again.

(***) If the host file is an under-a-100kb *.exe, instead of an image 
     file, you won't have to rename the extension when extracting zips. Zip utilitys 
     recognise the exe extension...M$ Notepad.exe would be such a file :)
