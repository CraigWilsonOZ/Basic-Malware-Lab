This repo has been set up to host a Basic Malware Lab environment. It will provide the environment configuration using Hyper-V as well as steps to review Malware.

This project will develop a process to perform Malware Analysis. The process will review Malware in two stages, Static Analysis and Dynamic Analysis.

[Environment Setup](Environment/readme.md); will look at how to set up the envirnoment ready for reviewing the malware.

[Statis Analysis](Static%20Analysis/readme.md); will look at the Malware in a safe environment, using tools and information collected from existing Malware.

[Dynamic Analysis](Dynamic%20Analysis/readme.md); will look at the system once the Malware has been activated. Tools will capture the system pre and post activation of the Malware.
